# Osma

By most measures, Ozma does not exist. It has no budget, no known command structure, no executive order justifying its existence. Occasionally a Firewall team will stumble through the layers of false fronts to collide with an Ozma agent. The little data collected on Ozma is from those chance encounters, before their own clean-up squads eliminate the agent and all unlucky witnesses.

Ozma is a highly classified agency, operating on behalf of the Consortium, for purposes that are not completely understood. Its roots are in the SETI program of the 1960s, attempting to contact and understand extraterrestrial intelligence. Sometime before the rise of the TITANs, the program was officially terminated, only to be resurrected in a new form after the Fall. Ozma’s mission is unknown, but seems parallel to Firewall: monitoring alien, TITAN, and exsurgent activities, as well as other threats, including anything posing an existential risk to the Consortium itself. It is unclear if the Hypercorp Council is aware of the existence of Ozma — and if not, who Ozma ultimately answers to.
