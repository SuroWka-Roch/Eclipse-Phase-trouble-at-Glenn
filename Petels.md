PETALS
Petals are a narrative hallucinogen, a nanodrug that hijacks your
senses and takes you on a game-like, highly immersive trip. They are
post-Fall society’s heroin — the drug of choice for the desperate and
fucked. Petals are made in the form of nanopharmaceutical flowers,
potted or with a nutrient pack attached to the stem. Plucking and
swallowing the petals from the flower triggers the effects. Each
flower has 1d6 + 4 petals. Multiple users may share the experience
if they take the petals within 1 minute of the first one being plucked;
after this all petals remaining on the flower fade to translucent
white and become inert.
Petal experiences are entire scenarios in and of themselves.
Some access your mesh inserts (you must enable access to your
implants voluntarily; if not, the drug has no effect other than
low-intensity LSD-like visual hallucinations), take control of your
entoptic displays, link to secretive mesh servers and other trip-
pers, and invade your sensorium with AR “hallucinations.” Others
put you into a near-comatose state during which you go on a
head trip. Normally there is a well-developed theme or plot to a
petal experience, though others are just streams of thematically-
linked images.
