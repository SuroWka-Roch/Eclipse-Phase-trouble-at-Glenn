## Diana
Info morph working at [[Glenn]] station. It's a person refusing to play [[Glenn's-petal]] when game becomes crazy she sends emergency broadcast with drastic skirmish and hidden message (Programming -20) "Stop the game".

### Stop The game

Broadcast shows fight between some biological morph trying to protect themself form approach crazy looking person. Approacher slowly comes with metal spear protector scared moves around with steel pipe. When distracted robotic morph attacks from behind with club bringing to the ground in one hit. There robot repetitively hits person in chest killing it in couple hits. Awful sound. During this time biological morph celebrates. 
After killing spear is used to force open jaw. Both attackers start to remove teeth from body/lower jaw. Broadcast is cut short when biological morph starts using their teeth to take some more deep rooted tooth's.
