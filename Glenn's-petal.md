Pulling it's legs will release biological substance and scanning code on it's wings will connect you to server as a family (ppl taking drug from the same scarab) and allows to play corporate team-building exercises like capture virtual flag from other families or virtual competitive mushroom picking. 
PC can find out from logs that most of people play those games, they are consider somehow mandatory. A lot of workers were considering those games boring and were asking to make those more interesting.

###  [[Andrew-Smith]] patch
During the [[Ozma]] operation on [[Glenn]] there was a patch applied to game so it becomes more aggressive. If PC get access to code they will be able to make a programming test to note that the patch was made in a different style then rest of program. Program was started as a side project and is written as one. The patch given by [[Andrew-Smith|Smith]] is done is corporate coder style. If the programming test fails it will look for PC that there is a simple bug in code that accidentally caused problems.
