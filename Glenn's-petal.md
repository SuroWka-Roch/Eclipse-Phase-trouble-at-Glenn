###  [[Andrew-Smith]] patch
During the [[Ozma]] operation on [[Glenn]] there was a patch applied to game so it becomes more aggressive. If PC get access to code they will be able to make a programming test to note that the patch was made in a different style then rest of program. Program was started as a side project and is written as one. The patch given by [[Andrew-Smith|Smith]] is done is corporate coder style. If the programming test fails it will look for PC that there is a simple bug in code that accidentally caused problems.
