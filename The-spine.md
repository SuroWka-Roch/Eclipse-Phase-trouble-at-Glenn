# The-spine

Place where the reactor and all of life sustaining have place. Most importantly this is a place that connects all off places on the station allowing for simple jumps without stress.

## Entry  

Entry to the spine is protected by singular [[turret]]. When triggered first there will be a discharge of emp to damage swarms after then turret will drop. 


## Another entry 
With good knowledge tech you can find other entrance. When pc are noisy inside station AI will send [[guardian-angel]] to protect the spine.
